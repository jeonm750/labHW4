		<h3> The Story of Banana Flavored Milk </h3>
		<p>Since 1974, 800,000 bottles of Banana Flavored Milk are sold each day in Korea and around 6 billion bottles have been sold across the country. According to Binggrae, 150 billion Korean won worth of these bottles have been sold in 2014 alone. 
		</p>
		<p> Banana Flavored Milk got its flavor because the Korean government wanted to encourage Korean citizens to drink more milk. At the time Binggrae introduced its product, bananas were expensive and considered a luxury. They believed consumers would be enticed to purchase their milk for a taste of the fruit. </p>
		<p> The banana-flavored milk was first exported to the U.S. and is been sold over the countries including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It was launched in China in 2008 and increased its sales from 700 million Korean Won in 2010 and 15 billion in 2013. Many Thai consumers came to the Korean Pavilion of the Bangkok Food Fair held on May 31, 2017 to June 4, 2017 to taste this product.</p>
